But you already know that. I'm a developer living in Pune, India. I like it here
not just because it's my hometown but also because the weather is usually quite
pleasant all year round.

I’ve studied Engineering (Information Technology) at Pune Institute of Computer
Technology, 2013 batch. Never thought that I’ll actually be proud of it. 

My spare time is spent reading Comics and fighting with other fans on Facebook
over it. Occasionally, I updated my knowledge of human anatomy, finance, music.
I’m a struggling poet (and that’s me being very modest). I’m found playing
guitar or drums, at times. Only music can soothe my nerves. I <s>write</s> used
to write on Quora back when I was in college, but I gave up. I'll be resuming
soon, so keep an eye.

I'm ***@decached*** on most services. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.alias }}), [Quora](https://quora.com/{{ site.author | slugify }}), [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.alias }}) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/{{ site.alias }}), or let's [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }})

I also have a personal blog [kothawale.com](https://kothawale.com).
